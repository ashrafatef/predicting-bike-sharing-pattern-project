# Predicting Bike Sharing Pattern Project

## Project Description 

- This project about predict daily bike rental ridership , to imporve quantity of bikes we need daily. The main idea of this project is to build neural network from scratch without using any framework , be familair with the machine learning pipeline from loading data to making prediction after training .

## Stack
  
- numpy
- panda 
- matplotlib

## Dataset

- You can find the dataset in ** Bike-Sharing-Dataset** folder

## What I leant in this project 

- Load and pre-processing dataset , training and test split 
- Build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset
- Solid understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation
- Build the whole pipeline from load data to train and test my predictions 
- Working with hyperparamters and know their effect on the model accuracy
